# analyticjeremy.github.io
a GitHub pages repo to serve up my personal site

This is the repo that contains the compiled version of my web site.  It is served by GitHub pages.

For the full source code, visit my "[blog](/AnalyticJeremy/blog)" repo.  It shows all of the code used in each blog post.  It also has
all of the site config files (in case you're interested in setting up your own site... which you should definitely do!)
