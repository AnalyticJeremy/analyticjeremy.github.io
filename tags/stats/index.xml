      <description>The 2006-07 NHL season was the Nashville Predators’ best regular season. With Tomáš Vokoun in goal and great players like Paul Kariya, Jason Arnott, and Steve Sullivan up front, the team set a franchise record with 110 points. Now, eleven years later, the Predators have a pretty good team once again. Will this team finally be the one to surpass the ’06-07 team and earn at least 111 points?
So far this season, the Preds have played 55 games and earned 77 points.</description>
